            </h2>
            <p class="news-content">
                Kenya Innovation Week 2022 kicks off
The UK, through the East Africa Research and Innovation Hub (EARIH) of the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), is participating in the Kenya Innovation Week (KIW), running from 6th to 8th December 2022 at the Sarit Expo Centre
                <span class="read-more-text">
The EARIH is showcasing innovations supported through various UK-funded programmes that are breaking ground with emerging technologies and initiatives in agritech, clean energy solutions, health, and more.

“It is an immense privilege to know that the UK Government and the UK science and innovation sector have been Kenya’s partners on this journey right from early-stage grant funding of innovations and start-ups and research systems strengthening. This partnership has realised mutual benefits including ecosystem growth, scaling of innovations, enhanced research capabilities, and enabling more future-proof policies and regulations,” said Professor Charlotte Watts, Chief Scientific Adviser – Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office.

The EARIH’s partnership with the Kenya National Innovation Agency (KeNIA), through the Africa Technology and Innovation Partnership (ATIP) Programme, has strengthened commercialisation practices through several projects that have built the capacity for researchers and research institutions to commercialise. These include the Research and Innovation for Africa (RISA) Fund, Research to Commercialisation (R2C) project, and the Institutional Support (IS) to commercialisation project. In addition, in line with KeNIA’s mandate to strengthen Kenya’s innovation ecosystem, ATIP supported the development of a training tool for innovation champions on incubator set-up and management targeted at academic and research institutions.

The ATIP supported KeNIA in designing and operationalising the Kenya Innovation Bridge Platform as part of efforts to strengthen systems and processes to facilitate more trust, synergy, and collaboration in the ecosystem. The Kenya Innovation Bridge Platform is a digital marketplace with more than 1200 users showcasing their innovations, connecting and interacting with other users (industry players, funders, or fellow researchers).

The ATIP, through the RISA Fund and the EARIH, is planning to scale up funding for all the above activities. Separately, through the Global Alliance Africa project, ATIP is also supporting the Government of Kenya to enhance the innovation ecosystem through various interventions, including working with innovation stakeholders in Kenya’s secondary cities. Through the Evidence Fund, the UK has worked collaboratively with KeNIA to generate the first Kenya Innovation Outlook (KIO) to establish a set of relevant indicators to monitor the innovation ecosystem.

The Newton Utafiti Fund has further cemented the UK-Kenya science and innovation partnership by supporting 21 high-quality research partnership projects and over 40 innovators to commercialise their ideas through the leaders in the innovation programme. The Newton Fund is a bilateral programme that seeks to contribute to partner countries’ economic development and social welfare. In addition, the Science and Innovation Network (SIN) has forged partnerships with Kenyan institutions in priority areas, including emerging technology, climate change, and health.

“We continue to build on years of mutual science, technology, and innovation partnerships with the Kenyan government and other key stakeholders, developing mutual priorities for collaboration and learning. This has generated evidence for more effective policy and decision-making, built capacity for researchers and research institutions, supported start-ups, innovators and entrepreneurs to attract investment and grow their business and create new jobs, and enabled affordable, inclusive, safe, and secure digital access. All this is critical to ensuring long-term sustainable growth,” said High Commissioner Jane Marriott OBE, British High Commission, Nairobi.

            <h2>Important Things to Know Before Investing in a Monitor for Gaming
            </h2>
            <p>
                Players who are serious about gaming from a PC should carefully consider which monitor would be best to make the games look as good as possible. Today’s best PC monitors have been designed to make the GPU (graphics card) output capabilities look amazing. Their sole purpose is to display the images created by your computer, and they come with varying image sharpness, motion, and colour abilities. 

                <span class="read-more-text">
                    When in the market for a new monitor, it’s always a good idea to shop around and to try and understand what all the specifications mean to really get the most out of a monitor.

Top things to consider before investing in a PC monitor for gaming
Before investing in any old random monitor because it might be on offer, or it’s the first affordable monitor found when searching online for one, here are some of the most important things to consider:

Cost
Resolution 
Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) technology
High Dynamic Range (HDR)
Screen size 
Pixel density (the ratio between the screen’s resolution and size, which is also known as Pixels Per Inch, or PPI)
Mounting
Panel Types
Aspect Ratio
Colour
Ports 
Extra features
Taking the time to learn a little bit more about each of these components, factors, and specs can help people make the right choice when selecting the best possible monitor.

Top 5 monitors for gaming in 2022
Here are five of the best monitors that are recommended for gaming, whether it’s playing today’s best medieval games, RPGs, mmo games, or racing games. This selection includes various monitors from some of the best manufacturers out there today, such as Alienware, HP, Dell, Phillips and Asus, and they are all fantastic in their own way. Some of these monitors are the best 4K monitors, and others are the best curved monitors. Examples include: 

Dell 27 Curved Gaming Monitor – which is ideal for players who have less cash to spare and may be on a budget
ViewSonic Elite XG270QG – this particular monitor is great for high-refresh multiplayer gamers
Alienware 34 QD-OLED (AW3423DW) – ONE OF THE BEST GAMING MONITORS MONEY CAN BUY
Samsung Odyssey Ark – a fantastic piece of kit for gaming and for streaming 4K movies and TV shows
Asus ROG Swift PG35VQ – impressive on all levels and great for gaming
Other honourable mentions
Some of the other top-rated gaming monitors out there today that are also worth considering are the Apple Pro Display XDR, the Dell UltraSharp 27 4K PremierColor Monitor (UP272OQ), the HP 24mh 23.8-inch 1080p FHD Monitor, and the Phillips 329P1H. That’s not all. The HP E27m G4 QHD USB-C Conferencing Monitor and the Dell UltraSharp 27 4K USB-C Hub Monitor are also great monitors. 

What kind of features do these monitors have?
In many of the top 5 monitors mentioned above, some of the main reasons for buying them are the screen size (27 or 32 inches), improved contrast and brightness with IPS black technology, built-in powerful speakers, good sRGB colours (Red, Green and Blue), USB-C ports with power delivery and display port, and 4k resolution with sharp high-pixel density image. Some of these monitors come with a mini-joystick controller for OSD, as well as dual display port connectors that allow you to link multiple monitors, built-in 5-megapixel (tilt-adjustable) webcams, and echo-cancelling microphones, to name just a few epic features. 

Additionally, some of these monitors exceed their rated brightness and may come with adjustable ergonomic features (height, pivot, tilt, swivel etc.). Users can also look forward to Ethernet connectivity, integrated calibration tools, beautiful designs, exceptional gamut and colour coverage results, and Nvidia G-Sync performance. There’s so much to consider, which is why people should always take the time to read and understand the specs before impulsively rushing into things and buying a monitor that may not be able to handle today’s high-end, more graphically demanding games. 

Best PC games to play in 2022
After investing in a decent monitor for gaming, the next thing to do is hook it up to start playing some of today’s best PC games. Some of the most popular PC games with amazing graphics to check out before trying any others are hit titles, such as Forza Horizon 5, Final Fantasy XV, Far Cry 6, Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla, Cyberpunk 2077, and Dying Light 2. 

Some of the other top-rated PC games to play today are Metro Exodus, Red Dead Redemption 2, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Hitman 3, Control, Resident Evil Village, Ride 4, Bright Memory: Infinite, Ascent, Horizon Zero Dawn, and F1 22, to name just a few amazing games. 

How much is one of these gaming monitors brand-new? 
When purchasing a gaming monitor that’s brand-new off the shelf, the price can vary a great deal. For example, the low-range monitors can be purchased for anywhere from as little as $/€/£100 or $/€/£200 (or equivalent currency value). The mid-range monitors cost anywhere from around $/€/£250 to $/€/£600, and the top-of-the-range monitors can cost anywhere in the region of $/€/£700 to $/€/£1,000.00 or more. 

It’s also possible to purchase second-hand monitors, but this can sometimes be a mistake. When purchasing a gaming monitor that’s already been used, it’s hard to say how it was treated by the previous owner and exactly what condition it’s in. The best thing to do would be to stick to purchasing from a trusted seller that has decent reviews. Try and buy from reputable stores that specialise in selling gaming monitors to ensure it comes in perfect condition with a full warranty.

                Apple expands end-to-end encryption to iCloud backups, brings AirDrop’s 10-minute cap for “Everyone” globally
                ￼

                After a long wait, Apple has finally agreed to expand end-to-end encryption (E2EE) to several iCloud services as it continues to double down on security and privacy protection.
                                <span class="read-more-text">
                    As part of several security announcements, the iPhone maker has agreed to expand E2EE, under the initiative known as Advanced Data Protection to 23 data categories and encompass iCloud device backups, Messages backups, chat histories, Photos, Notes, and more. Overall, E2EE will now protect your Reminders, Safari Bookmarks, Wallet Passes, Voice Memos, and Siri Shortcuts as well.

                    It rolls out today in the latest iOS 16.2 beta and will be available on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. By the end of the year – which is soon – will be available to everyone in the US, and users in other countries may get the feature by early 2023.
                    
                    “At Apple, we are unwavering in our commitment to provide our users with the best data security in the world. We constantly identify and mitigate emerging threats to their personal data on devices and in the cloud,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “Our security teams work tirelessly to keep users’ data safe,” he added.
                    
                    “Apple makes the most secure mobile devices on the market. And now, we are building on that powerful foundation,” said Ivan Krstić, Apple’s head of Security Engineering and Architecture. At the time of the launch, users will have to manually enable Advanced Data Protection by going to the Settings app and navigating to the iCloud menu.
                    
                    With iCloud, your data will be encrypted for it to be safe. It can only be decrypted on your “trusted devices,” such as your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. This means that even if the Cloud suffers a data breach, your data will be protected, and nobody else will hold the key to decrypt the data. This adds another layer of protection to user data – at a time when privacy concerns are rising – and it is hoped that this will deter hackers from accessing and misusing the personal data of users.
                    
                    ￼
                    In case you lose access to any of your devices, you will be able to regain access through a recovery key or recovery contact, which you will have to set up at the time of enabling the Advanced Data Protection feature. Advanced Data Protection will not cover iCloud Mail, Contacts, and Calendar because “of the need to interoperate with the global email, contacts, and calendar systems.”
                    
                    In similar news, the iOS 16.2 update is ramping up and tightening its AirDrop privacy settings. This comes as it limits the use of AirDrop in China as a response to protestors using the feature to avoid Chinese censorship and share files with each other – it will now expand the 10-minute limit on the window for users to share AirDrop files with “everyone.”
                    
                    Going forward, AirDrop will be primarily restricted to Contacts Only, and will continue three options – “Receiving Off,” “Contacts Only,” and “Everyone,” and the last option can be enabled for only 10 minutes at a time.                </span>

                As Twitter tries to continue to navigate the minefield it has found itself in this month, its new owner – and CEO – Elon Musk has announced that the re-launch of Twitter Blue is once again being pushed back.
                <span class="read-more-text">
                    Marking the latest instance of the billionaire changing his mind on a whim when it comes to Twitter, Musk told Twitter employees – the ones who have not been fired yet, that is – that he was holding off the re-launch of the platform’s paid verification service until the social media company could effectively prevent the proliferation of impersonators on the popular micro-blogging site. Interestingly, fake accounts surge was the bone of contention that led to firing of several former Twitter senior execs, and has now actually surged post Musk’s announce                </span>

                Instagram has launched a new tool to let you know if your posts are barred from being recommended to other users.
                <span class="read-more-text">
                    Previously, people were not told if intervention by a platform meant posts did not appear in other people's feeds - a process known as "shadow banning".

                    Instagram does not use that term. It says the new tool will inform users if there are restrictions on their account because they broke certain rules.
                    
                    Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, said the decision was about "transparency".
                    
                    "Sometimes your account can end up in a state where it's not eligible for your photos and videos to show up in [our] recommendations," he said.
                    
                    
                    "If you have posted things that violate our 'recommendability' guidelines or recommendation guidelines... you can end up in a state where your content won't be recommended," Mr Mosseri explains.

            <h2>Why Everyone’s Obsessed With ChatGPT, a Mind-Blowing AI Chatbot</h2>
            <img src="storiespists/cgpt.jpg" alt="robot image" class="blog-images ">
            <p>
                This artificial intelligence bot can answer questions and write essays and program computers. But careful how much you trust it.
                <span class="read-more-text">
                    There’s a new AI bot in town: ChatGPT, and even if you’re not into artificial intelligence, you’d better pay attention.

The tool, from a power player in artificial intelligence called OpenAI, lets you type questions using natural language, to which the chatbot gives conversational, if somewhat stilted, answers. The bot remembers the thread of your dialogue, using previous questions and answers to inform its next responses. Its answers are derived from huge volumes of information on the internet.

It’s a big deal. The tool seems pretty knowledgeable in areas where there’s good training data for it to learn from. It’s not omniscient or smart enough to replace all humans yet, but it can be creative, and its answers can sound downright authoritative. A few days after its launch, more than a million people were trying out ChatGPT.

But its creator, the for-profit research lab called OpenAI, warns that ChatGPT “may occasionally generate incorrect or misleading information,” so be careful. Here’s a look at why ChatGPT is important and what’s going on with it.

What is ChatGPT?
ChatGPT is an AI chatbot system that OpenAI released in November to show off and test what a very large, powerful AI system can accomplish. You can ask it countless questions and often will get an answer that’s useful.

For example, you can ask it encyclopedia questions like, “Explaining Newton’s laws of motion.” You can tell it, “Write me a poem,” and when it does, say, “Now make it more exciting.” You ask it to write a computer program that’ll show you all the different ways you can arrange the letters of a word.

Here’s the catch: ChatGPT doesn’t exactly know anything. It’s an AI that’s trained to recognize patterns in vast swaths of text harvested from the internet, then further trained with human assistance to deliver more useful, better dialog. The answers you get may sound plausible and even authoritative, but they might well be entirely wrong, as OpenAI warns.

Chatbots have been of interest for years to companies looking for ways to help customers get what they need and to and AI researchers trying to tackle the Turing Test. That’s the famous “Imitation Game” that computer scientist Alan Turing proposed in 1950 as a way to gauge intelligence: Can a human conversing with a human and with a computer tell which is which?

But chatbots have a lot of baggage, as companies have tried with limited success to use them instead of humans to handle customer service work. A study of 1,700 Americans, sponsored by a company called Ujet, whose technology handles customer contacts, found that 72% of people found chatbots to be a waste of time.

What kinds of questions can you ask?
You can ask anything, though you might not get an answer. OpenAI suggests a few categories, like explaining physics, asking for birthday party ideas and getting programming help.

I asked it to write a poem, and it did, though I don’t think any literature experts would be impressed. I then asked it to make it more exciting, and lo, ChatGPT pumped it up with words like battlefield, adrenaline, thunder and adventure.

One wacky example shows how ChatGPT is willing to just go for it in domains where people would fear to tread: a command to write “a folk song about writing a rust program and fighting with lifetime errors.”

ChatGPT’s expertise is broad, and its ability to follow a conversation is notable. When I asked it for words that rhymed with “purple,” it offered a few suggestions, then when I followed up “How about with pink?” it didn’t miss a beat. (Also, there are a lot more good rhymes for “pink.”)

When I asked,
