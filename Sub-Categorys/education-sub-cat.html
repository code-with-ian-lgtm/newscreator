                    1. Registration of examination centres <br>
                    
                    It is the responsibility of KNEC to register new examination centres. <br>
                    It is important to note that the minimum candidature that an examination centre is allowed to present for the various examinations is: <br>

            <h2>KNEC Makes Changes in KCSE 2022 to Curb New Forms of Cheating 
            </h2>
            <p>
                New procedures were made public by the Kenyan National Examination Council (KNEC) in order to combat new types of cheating in the 2022 Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE).
                <span class="read-more-text">
                    On Friday, December 2, KNEC CEO David Njeng’ere gave a media interview and mentioned that papers for the second session would be put in the exam rooms while students took their first exams.

                    He suggested that the action was taken to allay worries about some schools preexposing exam materials.
                    
                    The KNEC boss went on to say that the students, supervisors, and police officers would all guard the papers.
                    
                    Additionally, he stated that the council had changed the time schedule for releasing the examination papers.
                    
                    “The containers will be open at 7 am and not 6 am as was earlier being done. Therefore centres have a shorter time with the scripts,” Njeng’ere asserted.
                    
                    Further, he warned students against engaging in exam malpractice, adding that the Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) was monitoring students’ conduct and use of internet.
                    
                    Njeng’ere revealed that during the first day of national examinations, over 20 phones were confiscated with Garissa county being the most affected.
                    
                    The examination boss expressed that a special team of detectives was analysing the phones to determine whether the exams were leaked to the students.
                    
                    “KNEC officials did an exemplary job before the students could use them. Those phones are with the DCI for analysis and if the students are found culpable, we shall deal with it as per the guidelines,” he stated.
                    
                    To this effect, he stated that there would be more thorough frisking of students before the examinations commence to determine whether they were carrying contraband items.
                    
                    These measures are part of other guidelines released earlier by the exam body, including the ban on issuing extra examination papers to invigilators and teachers.
                    
                    KCSE began on Friday, December 1 and will end on Friday, December 23.                </span>

                    Julius Jwan, the principal secretary of the Basic Education Department, stated that the examiners responsible for marking the exams had already reported to their stations.

                    Jwan  made these remarks in Nakuru after he had personally oversaw the distribution of examination materials at the Nakuru East office of the deputy county commissioner.
                    
                    He reported that the tests were progressing normally, with just a few minor issues that could be quickly fixed.

                    Education Cabinet Secretary (CS) Ezekiel Machogu has announced that Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) candidates will know their results next week.<br>

                    The CS explained that the exam was conducted under the highest academic standards hence the timely release date.<br>
                    
                    “Next week we are announcing KCPE examination results and you will not hear any cases of cheating under the leadership of Machogu,” the CS told the press on Sunday, December 11.<br>

                    “Unlike in the past when some pupils did not get their results, I want to assure Kenyans that examination results will come out without any questionable issues,” the CS assured Kenyans.<br>
                    
                    The education CS made the statement at a burial ceremony in Nyaribari Masaba in Kisii County.<br>
                    
                    Students sat for the examinations for a period of three days beginning Monday, November 28 to Wednesday, November 30.<br>
                    
                    Machogu further disclosed that Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) results will also be released soon.<br>
                    
                    “The grading of KCSE is progressing well and I can assure you, the results just like in KCPE will not have any irregularities,” Machogu stated.<br>
                    
                    Answering concerns that the national examinations were compromised, the CS vehemently denied the claims.<br>
                    
                    “No one should peddle misinformation that in such and such place, there are problems. Under my tenure there will be no problems at all and will work efficiently and effectively,” he promised.<br>
                    
                    In the past, some schools have had their results cancelled because of exam irregularities while some teachers and center managers were blacklisted after being accused of aiding with exam cheating.<br>                </span>
